# Python - import & modules
Simply, a `module` is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. We can import the definitions inside a module to another module by using the `import` command. For better concepts grasping, the following task files were used:-
## [0-add.py](../0x02-python-import_modules/0-add.py)
Program that imports the function def add(a, b): from other file and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3 with 1 and 2 stored in variables a and b
