# Python - if/else, loops, functions
Topic's aim was to understand:-
* Why Python programming is awesome :))
* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the `if, if ... else` statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the `while` and `for` loops
* How is Python’s `for` different from C‘s?
* How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
* How to use `else` clauses on loops
* What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it
* How to use `range`
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does return a function that does not use any `return` statement
* Scope of variables
* What’s a traceback
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

The following task files were used to complete the objective of the topic and help in grasping concepts
## [0-positive_or_negative.py](../0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py)
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Completes the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rkvoXPA-lS3TAaemM9sChg) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
* The variable `number` will store a different value every time you will run this program
* You don’t have to understand what `import, random. randint` do. Please do not touch this code
* The output of the program should be:

     * The number, followed by:
           * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
           * if the number is 0: `is zero`
           * if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
