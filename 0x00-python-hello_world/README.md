# Python - Hello, World
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Guido van Rossum was a Dutch programmer who created the Python programming language in 1991.
### This topic aim was to understand:-
* Using the Python Interpreter
* How To Use String Formatters in Python 3
* How to print text and variables using print
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
* What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with PEP 8
Below task files were used to achieve learning objectives and grasp concepts.
## [0-run](../0x00-python-hello_world/0-run)
Shell script that runs a Python script with the Python file name saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`
## [1-run_inline](../0x00-python-hello_world/1-run_inline)
Shell script that runs Python code with the Python code saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`
## [2-print.py](../0x00-python-hello_world/2-print.py)
Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
## [3-print_number.py](../0x00-python-hello_world/3-print_number.py)
You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py). 
The output of the script should be:
* the number, followed by Battery street,
* followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
* Your code must be 3 lines long
* You have to use the new print numbers tips (with .format(...))

## [4-print_float.py](../0x00-python-hello_world/4-print_float.py)
Completes the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py) in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.
## [5-print_string.py](../0x00-python-hello_world/5-print_string.py)
Completes [this](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.
* The output of the program should be:
* 3 times the value of str
          *followed by a new line
          *followed by the 9 first characters of str
          *followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
* Your program should be maximum 5 lines long
## [6-concat.py](../0x00-python-hello_world/6-concat.py)
Completes [this](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) source code to print `Welcome to Holberton School!`
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
* You have to use the variables `str1` and `str2` in your new line of code
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
